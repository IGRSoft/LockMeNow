UKLOGINITEMREGISTRY
--------------------

A wrapper class around Apple's LoginItemsAE sample code. Get Apple's LoginItemsAE code at:

http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/LoginItemsAE/index.html

You can use this class to easily add an application or file to the current user's list of login items, query whether it is currently on this list, and remove it again.

LICENSE:

(c) 2006 by M. Uli Kusterer. You may redistribute, modify, use in
commercial products free of charge, however distributing modified copies
requires that you clearly mark them as having been modified by you, while
maintaining the original markings and copyrights. I don't like getting bug
reports about code I wasn't involved in.

I'd also appreciate if you gave credit in your app's about screen or a similar
place. A simple "Thanks to M. Uli Kusterer" is quite sufficient.
Also, I rarely turn down any postcards, gifts, complementary copies of
applications etc.


REVISION HISTORY:
0.1 - Initial release.
